# HDestModList
This is the mod list for my managed Hideous Destructor games

# First Time Installs
If you've never installed mods before, this is the place to start.
## Requirements
You'll need the latest version of GZDOOM, which you can get [here](https://zdoom.org/downloads). You'll also need Doomrunner which you can get [here](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner/releases/). Install these as per normal. Make a directory for mods, maps, and IWADs, and point Doomrunner toward those.
## Installation
1. Either download this repository as a ZIP, or if you're savvy, clone it to your mods directory. 
2. Unpack it if you chose a zip file, and then load the mods in the order given in the file names. Ignore OPT and SKIN mods for now.
# Updates
To update this modpack, delete the mods directory and redownload, or git pull. Then follow the installation instructions from 2.
# OPT and SKINS
OPT is for optional mods that you can't keep loaded for normal gameplay. Load numbers for them will be kept in this document. Skins are technically optional, but if you don't have them enabled you can't use or see any skins. 
## Skins
Skins go at the end in any order you wish.
## Babuin's Forest
Goes between (2) and (3)
